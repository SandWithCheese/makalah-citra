\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that YOLO is a highly effective tool for automating the detection of subsurface hazards in seismic data. Our adapted model achieves high detection accuracy (0.84 mAP) while maintaining processing speeds suitable for large-scale datasets. This automated approach significantly reduces interpretation time and subjectivity. Future work will focus on extending the framework to 3D volumetric detection and integrating semi-supervised learning to leverage abundant unlabeled seismic data.
