\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Dataset Preparation}
Seismic data often spans kilometers in range, making it too large for direct input into standard CNNs. We employ an overlapping tiling strategy where large seismic sections are sliced into $W \times H$ tiles (default $1024 \times 1024$). To mitigate boundary effects, we apply a 25\% overlap. We also use percentile clipping (2\%-98\%) to handle amplitude outliers and normalize pixel intensities to $[0, 255]$ for 8-bit image conversion.

\subsection{YOLO Architecture}
We adopt the YOLOv8 architecture, which features a CSPDarknet backbone for feature extraction and a Path Aggregation Network (PANet) neck for multi-scale feature fusion. The decoupled head predicts objectness, class probabilities, and bounding box regression coordinates separately.

\subsection{Training Configuration}
The model is trained using transfer learning from COCO-pretrained weights to accelerate convergence.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Framework}: Ultralytics YOLO
    \item \textbf{Input Resolution}: $640 \times 640$ pixels
    \item \textbf{Optimizer}: SGD with momentum 0.937
    \item \textbf{Loss Function}: CIoU for box regression, BCE for classification
\end{itemize}
