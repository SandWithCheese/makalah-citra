\subsection{Seismic Reflection Data}
Seismic reflection profiles are 2D or 3D images of the subsurface generated by recording sound waves reflected from geological boundaries. These images are characterized by variable signal-to-noise ratios, complex textures, and non-standard visual features compared to natural images \cite{Seismic_Processing}. Subsurface hazards such as gas chimneys appear as vertical disturbances with chaotic amplitudes, while faults appear as lateral discontinuities in sedimentary layers.

\subsection{YOLO Object Detection}
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture that reframes object detection as a single regression problem, mapping image pixels directly to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities \cite{YOLO_v1}. Unlike two-stage detectors (e.g., R-CNN), YOLO processes the entire image in one pass, making it exceptionally fast and suitable for scanning large seismic volumes. We utilize the latest iteration (YOLOv8/v11) which incorporates anchor-free detection and advanced augmentation strategies.
